description: Produce validated Mermaid for a Markdown note. Use when choosing a diagram type or writing a ```mermaid block for any open-source Mermaid type (flowchart, sequence, class, state, ER, gantt, timeline, C4, charts, git, kanban, architecture, mindmap, and Mermaid 12 agentflow, usecase, wardley, railroad, and the rest). Prefer scripts/render.py when the content is structured data; validate every diagram with scripts/check.sh, which also rejects Mermaid error-placeholder SVGs.

# Mermaid

Produce Mermaid source for a Markdown ` ```mermaid ` fence. Done means the exact source you insert has passed `scripts/check.sh` (it prints `PASS`).

Run commands from this skill directory.

## Route

1. Pick a type from the table below.
2. **Structured content** (nodes, edges, tables, transitions, messages, requirements you already have) **and** [reference/coverage.md](reference/coverage.md) lists an IR for that type: write JSON and generate. Schemas: [reference/ir.md](reference/ir.md) (core families) and [reference/ir-catalog.md](reference/ir-catalog.md) (every other target). Hand-writing that Mermaid is the wrong path.
3. **Anything else**, including a gap named in the coverage matrix: hand-author from the one matching heading in [reference/type-cheatsheets.md](reference/type-cheatsheets.md). Open a single file under [reference/syntax/](reference/syntax/) only for a construct the cheatsheet does not show, or a second failed render. Do not open the cheatsheet and the syntax doc up front.
4. Validate, then put the fenced source in the note. Add an image only when the user asks for SVG, PNG, or PDF (`scripts/check.sh diagram.mmd -o out.svg`).

```bash
scripts/render.py diagram.json -o diagram.mmd   # IR only
scripts/check.sh diagram.mmd                     # always, on the exact final source
```

`check.sh` uses an installed `mmdc`, otherwise `npx -y @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli@12.0.0` (Node 22 or newer; Mermaid 11 does not register `agentflow-beta` or `usecase-beta`). A clean result is exit 0 **and** an SVG without Mermaid's error placeholder (`aria-roledescription="error"`, `class="error-icon"`, or `Syntax error in text`). The CLI can exit 0 while writing that placeholder; `check.sh` fails the run when it sees one. On failure, change the reported line and re-run. Do not re-render unchanged source.

If `check.sh` cannot run, deliver the source and say once that it is unverified.

Control-flow flowcharts use ISO 5807 shapes (terminator, process, decision, I/O, subprocess, document, store, connector). IR flowchart `kind` values are those shapes. When hand-authoring, follow [reference/iso-5807-flowcharts.md](reference/iso-5807-flowcharts.md).

## IR targets

`{"diagram": "<family>", "target": "<keyword>"}`. Every open-source diagram type has a serializer. Features it does not emit are the gaps column in [reference/coverage.md](reference/coverage.md). Core schemas are in [reference/ir.md](reference/ir.md). The rest (timeline keyword, charts, kanban, packet, git, journey, C4 component/dynamic/deployment, swimlane, agentflow, wardley, tree, cynefin, event model, railroad, use case, zenuml, `info`) are in [reference/ir-catalog.md](reference/ir-catalog.md).

`render.py` fails closed (unknown kinds, undeclared endpoints, a mindmap that is not a tree, a gantt or timeline label that contains `:`). It does not render. `check.sh` is still required.

## Choosing a type

| The note needs to show… | Keyword |
|---|---|
| Steps, decisions, branching | `flowchart` (ISO 5807 when it is control flow) |
| Messages between actors | `sequenceDiagram` |
| Object model | `classDiagram` |
| Lifecycle transitions | `stateDiagram-v2` |
| Entities and relationships | `erDiagram` |
| Dated schedule with dependencies | `gantt` |
| Events over time, no dependencies | `timeline` |
| Proportions | `pie` |
| Git history | `gitGraph` |
| Hierarchy | `mindmap` |
| Satisfaction per step | `journey` |
| 2×2 priority | `quadrantChart` |
| Requirements and links | `requirementDiagram` |
| C4 (context, container, component, dynamic, deployment) | `C4Context` / `C4Container` / `C4Component` / `C4Dynamic` / `C4Deployment` |
| Static composition or a grid | `block` |
| Quantities between nodes | `sankey` |
| Line or bar chart | `xychart` |
| Services with icons | `architecture-beta` |
| Columns of cards | `kanban` |
| Packet layout | `packet` |
| Multi-axis comparison | `radar-beta` |
| Nested proportions | `treemap-beta` |
| Set overlap | `venn-beta` |
| Process lanes | `swimlane-beta` |
| Agent workflow (Mermaid 12) | `agentflow-beta` |
| Use cases (Mermaid 12) | `usecase-beta` |
| Value chain | `wardley-beta` |
| Directory tree | `treeView-beta` |
| Cause and effect | `ishikawa-beta` |
| Cynefin domains | `cynefin-beta` |
| Event-model frames | `eventmodeling` |
| Grammar railroad | `railroad-ebnf-beta` |
| ZenUML sequence | `zenuml` |
| Renderer version | `info` |

The full matrix (docs, IR, tests, remaining gaps) is [reference/coverage.md](reference/coverage.md). `reference/diagram-types.md` is the cached directory list (stamp at the top). It omits `common` and `error`. `check.sh` uses the installed CLI, which may be newer than that stamp.

## Hand-author traps

- The first line is the diagram keyword. Quote labels that contain punctuation: `A["Order (paid)"]`.
- Gantt: the first `:` on a task line starts metadata. A colon inside the title (`Review: security :done, ...`) makes the renderer throw `TypeError` rather than a line error. Keep titles free of `:`. The IR generator rejects those labels.
- `architecture-beta` titles that the lexer rejects often come back as an error-placeholder SVG. Mermaid 11.16 rejected punctuation such as `[ESP32-S3 firmware]`; Mermaid 12 accepts it. Keep the real spelling and let `check.sh` decide.
- Built-in architecture icons: `cloud`, `database`, `disk`, `internet`, `server`. Other icons need a `pack:name` id.
- Prefer `stateDiagram-v2` when you need composites, notes, or choice/fork/join.
- If the coverage matrix names a gap (agentflow metadata, use-case notes, ZenUML `if`/`while`, Wardley `evolution` axis), hand-author that part from the cheatsheet. Do not invent keys the IR ignores.

## Repair and cache

Render the broken source once, then fix the line or token in the error. Open syntax docs only if that error is ambiguous. A second failure is the point to load the one cached syntax file for that type.

`scripts/refresh.sh` rewrites `reference/diagram-types.md` and `reference/syntax/` from mermaid-js. Run it when the user asks, or when a live doc shows the cache is missing a type. A single failed diagram is not a reason to refresh.

`scripts/setup-mcp.sh` only configures Mermaid MCP for Claude Code, and only when the user asks. A host that already has a Mermaid render tool may use it for the final render; still reject an error-placeholder SVG. `check.sh` is the path this package tests.
